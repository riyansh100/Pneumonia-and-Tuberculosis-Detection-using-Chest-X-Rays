# Pneumonia-and-Tuberculosis-Detection-using-Chest-X-Rays
This project implements a deep learning–based multi-class image classification system to detect Tuberculosis (TB) and Pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It compares the performance of various convolutional neural network architectures  ResNet50, InceptionV3, MobileVNetV2 and a Custom CNN.
